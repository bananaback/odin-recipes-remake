    <h1>Phở (Vietnamese Noodle Soup)</h1>
    <img src="pho.jpg" alt="Phở image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vietnamese pho is all about the broth! In this authentic recipe, beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger
        simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly
        delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh
        garnishes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Because you're making this authentic Vietnamese soup completely from scratch, the ingredient list is a little
        hefty. Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 pounds beef soup bones (shank and knee)</li>
        <li> 1 medium onion, unpeeled and cut in half</li>
        <li> 5 slices fresh ginger</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li> 2 pods star anise</li>
        <li> 2 ½ tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li> 4 quarts water</li>
        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li> 1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li> ½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped green onion</li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups bean sprouts</li>
        <li> 1 bunch Thai basil</li>
        <li> 1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        <li> ¼ cup hoisin sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li> ¼ cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45
            minutes.</li>
        <li> Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4
            quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a
            saucepan and set aside.</li>
        <li> Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</li>
        <li> When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</li>
        <li> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</li>
        <li> Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the
            top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li> Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
