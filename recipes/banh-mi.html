    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vietnam has one signature sandwich: bánh mì. It is a tour de force comprised of light, crisp baguette-style bread
        often moistened by mayonnaise and containing pickled daikon and carrots, cucumber, cilantro, chili, and a
        featured protein element. For this recipe by metzstar, the featured protein is chicken, but you can put nearly
        any protein in the bánh mì framework and it'll be delicious. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this bánh mì recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> ½ cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li> ¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li> ¼ cup water</li>
        <li> ¼ cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li> ¼ cup peeled and matchstick-cut daikon radish</li>
        <li> ¼ cup thinly sliced white onion</li>
        <li> 1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half</li>
        <li> 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li> ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1 (12 inch) French baguette</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li> ¼ cup thinly sliced cucumber</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li> 1 small jalapeño pepper, cut into 1/16-inch-thick matchsticks</li>
        <li> 1 wedge lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until
            sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool.</li>
        <li> Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinate at least 30
            minutes. While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
            broiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.</li>
        <li> Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the center,
            about 6 minutes per side.</li>
        <li> Place chicken on a cutting board. Cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li> Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft center of the bread, leaving a cavity for the
            fillings.</li>
        <li> Lightly toast baguette under the broiler, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li> Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables have marinated.</li>
        <li> To assemble the sandwich, spread each half of toasted baguette with mayonnaise. Layer chicken on the bottom
            half of the bread. Top with cucumber, drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapeño. Squeeze lime wedge
            over fillings and cover with top half of baguette.</li>
        <li> Cut into two 6-inch sandwiches to serve.</li>
    </ol>
